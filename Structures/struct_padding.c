/*Struct Padding
You are given a struct with the following fields in order:

char a
int b
short c
Your task is to:

Declare a variable of this struct
Compute the offset (in bytes) of each field from the base address of the struct (i.e., &s)
Print:
 
Offset of a
Offset of b
Offset of c
Total size of the struct
 
Example Output

Offset of a: 0  
Offset of b: 4  
Offset of c: 8  
Size: 12
